Carnival-style wheel for when choosing is too energy draining.

Add the the main categories (and subcategories optionally) in a dictionary and let your computer choose one for you. If the first option doesn't feel right, try the second one. There will never be 2 fighting for the same spot! (except for that 1 case)

Python dictionary for random percentage assigned to a number of categories, with the possibility for nesting. 

Future work: 
- scalable - all the relevant code is based on the number of categories you manually instert, be that 2 or 100, (future alex problem: what if 2 categories and the first gets 50) you don't need to change the code for it to work. 
- nested choice - you have the posibility of subchoices in a choice
- spinning motion
- steam API to get all owned/downloaded games for the game category
