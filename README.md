Carnival-style wheel for when choosing is too energy draining.

## Usage:
Add the the main categories (and subcategories optionally) in the dictionary *thisdict* and let your computer choose one for you.

## Perks: 
- multiple options - If the first option doesn't feel right, you can try the second one
- (almost) no competition - There will never be 2 fighting for the same spot! (except for that 1 case)
- scalable - use as many categories as you want, no need to modify the code
- nested choice - press the button for the computer to select a subcategory for you
- reroll - if you don't like the proposed subcategory, just give it another shot! 

Python dictionary for random percentage assigned to a number of categories, with the possibility for nesting. 

## Future work: 
- what if 2 categories and the first gets 50
- nested choice - you have the posibility of subchoices in a choice
- spinning motion
- steam API to get all owned/downloaded games for the game category
- reroll button for stage 1
- find a way to keep it pretty when 1 option gets 99% and all others are crowding up in 1%
- bias check
