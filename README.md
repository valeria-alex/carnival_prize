Carnival-style wheel for when choosing is too energy draining.

Add the the main categories (and subcategories optionally) in a dictionary and let your computer choose one for you. If the first choice doesn't feel right, try the second option. There will never be 2 fighting for the same spot! 

Python dictionary for random percentage assigned to a number of categories. 
Key-things about the project: 
- scalable - all the relevant code is based on the number of categories you manually instert, be that 2 or 100, (future alex problem: what if 2 categories and the first gets 50) you don't need to change the code for it to work. 
- nested choice - you have the posibility of subchoices in a choice
